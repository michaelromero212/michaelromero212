# Hi, I'm Michael 👋

## AI Operations | Applied AI Analyst | AI Tooling Specialist

I bridge the gap between AI development and enterprise-grade deployment. My focus is on **AI Operations (AIOps)**—ensuring that LLMs and autonomous agents are observable, resilient, and business-integrated.

### 🛠️ Featured Work

#### [HR Ticket Triage & Auto-Resolution Agent](https://github.com/michaelromero212/HR-Ticket-Triage-Auto-Resolution-Agent)
*AI-powered HR automation with real-time analytics, PII protection, and responsible AI governance.*
- **Problem**: HR departments face high volumes of repetitive inquiries, slow response times, and inconsistent information delivery—while needing to protect sensitive employee data.
- **Solution**: An enterprise-grade ticketing system that auto-classifies requests into 15 HR categories, resolves common questions (PTO, benefits, 401k) using RAG-grounded responses, and escalates sensitive issues automatically. Features real-time analytics, automatic PII detection/redaction, and a comprehensive AI governance framework.
- **Business Impact**: Achieves 54.8% ticket deflection rate, reduces resolution time from 24+ minutes to 3.5 minutes, and demonstrates full-stack AI Ops capabilities: HuggingFace integration, confidence-based escalation thresholds, and WCAG 2.1 AA compliant UI.

#### [AI SDR Performance Operations Dashboard](https://github.com/michaelromero212/AI-SDR-Performance-Operations-Dashboard)
*Production-grade AI agent lifecycle management with governance, QA, and real-time monitoring.*
- **Problem**: Managing AI sales agents at scale requires governance, quality assurance, and continuous optimization—not just LLM deployment.
- **Solution**: A complete AI Operations platform featuring automated QA (15+ test scenarios), compliance frameworks, A/B testing, conversion analytics, and real-time agent monitoring.
- **Business Impact**: Demonstrates the full AI Ops PM skill set: process optimization, governance documentation, UAT coordination, KPI tracking, and field enablement.

#### [AI Operations GTM Simulator](https://github.com/michaelromero212/ai-ops-gtm-simulator)
*Operationalizing AI for scale.*
- **Problem**: GTM AI agents lack production-readiness guardrails and observable performance metrics.
- **Solution**: A simulation engine to stress-test and observe agent behavior in enterprise workflows.

#### [Databricks Knowledge Copilot](https://github.com/michaelromero212/Databricks-PS-Knowledge-Copilot)
*Enterprise RAG for Professional Services.*
- **Problem**: Knowledge latency in high-stakes consulting environments.
- **Solution**: A FastAPI + React assistant that provides grounded answers from authenticated technical documentation.

#### [Engagement Runbook Generator](https://github.com/michaelromero212/Databricks-PS-AI-Engagement-Runbook-Generator)
*Automating the consulting lifecycle.*
- **Problem**: Manual formatting of engagement artifacts is error-prone and time-intensive.
- **Solution**: An NLP-driven automation tool that transforms Slack exports and kickoff notes into client-ready runbooks.

#### [Enterprise Mission Intelligence Copilot](https://github.com/michaelromero212/enterprise-mission-intel-copilot)
*Turning unstructured data into actionable insights.*
- **Problem**: Critical mission data is often trapped in unstructured, high-latency formats.
- **Solution**: An Applied AI analyst tool for automated document intelligence and validated extraction.

### 🌐 Beyond the Code
I hold a **B.S. in Information Technology** from George Mason University and an active **DoD Secret Clearance**. My journey has taken me from automating **cybersecurity compliance and audit workflows at CACI** to engineering **high-scale AI data pipelines for deepfake detection at McAfee**. 

I am deeply passionate about **working with data**, **building interactive dashboards**, and **identifying business operations** that can be automated to drive efficiency. This GitHub profile serves as my primary project hub, where I host my work in bridging the gap between raw data and operational intelligence.

I specialize in building the "connective tissue"—the automation, observability, and data quality guardrails—that makes AI work in production.
