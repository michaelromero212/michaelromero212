# Hi, I'm Michael 👋

## AI Operations | Applied AI Analyst | AI Tooling Specialist

I bridge the gap between AI development and enterprise-grade deployment. My focus is on **AI Operations (AIOps)**—ensuring that LLMs and autonomous agents are observable, resilient, and business-integrated.

### 🛠️ Featured Work

#### [AI Operations GTM Simulator](https://github.com/michaelromero212/ai-ops-gtm-simulator)
*Operationalizing AI for scale.*
- **Problem**: GTM AI agents lack production-readiness guardrails.
- **Solution**: A simulation engine to stress-test and observe agent behavior in enterprise workflows.

#### [Enterprise Mission Intelligence Copilot](https://github.com/michaelromero212/enterprise-mission-intel-copilot)
*Turning unstructured data into mission-critical insights.*
- **Problem**: High-stakes data intake is slow and prone to human error.
- **Solution**: An Applied AI analyst tool for automated document intelligence and structured analysis.

#### [AI Pipeline Reliability Monitor](https://github.com/michaelromero212/ai-pipeline-reliability-monitor)
*Securing the AI lifecycle.*
- **Problem**: AI pipelines suffer from silent failures and data drift in security contexts.
- **Solution**: Real-time health monitoring for security-critical AI data pipelines.

### 🌐 Beyond the Code
I hold a **B.S. in Information Technology** from George Mason University and an active **DoD Secret Clearance**. My journey has taken me from automating **cybersecurity compliance and audit workflows at CACI** to engineering **high-scale AI data pipelines for deepfake detection at McAfee**. 

I view AI not just as a technology, but as a lever for operational transformation. I specialize in building the "connective tissue"—the automation, observability, and data quality guardrails—that makes AI work in production.
