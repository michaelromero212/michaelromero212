# Hi, I'm Michael 👋

## AI Operations | Applied AI Analyst | AI Tooling Specialist

I bridge the gap between AI development and enterprise-grade deployment. My focus is on **AI Operations (AIOps)**—ensuring that LLMs and autonomous agents are observable, resilient, and business-integrated.

### 🛠️ Featured Work

#### [CrowdStrike Sales Intelligence Dashboard](https://github.com/michaelromero212/Crowdstrike-Sales-Intelligence-Dashboard)
*AI-powered sales analytics dashboard demonstrating data automation, GenAI/LLM integration, and GTM analytics capabilities.*
- **Problem**: Sales teams spend 30+ minutes preparing for account reviews, lack visibility into churn risk factors, and struggle to prioritize at-risk accounts without unified analytics.
- **Solution**: A professional Streamlit dashboard featuring real-time portfolio KPIs (ARR, Health Scores, Churn Risk), AI-generated account summaries via HuggingFace LLMs, automated risk flag detection, next-best-action recommendations, and competitive intelligence with AI-powered battle cards.
- **Business Impact**: Reduces AE prep time from 30+ minutes to under 1 minute, provides instant AI-powered health assessments, and enables data-driven prioritization of at-risk accounts—demonstrating end-to-end GTM automation capabilities.

#### [GTM-AI-Workflow-Simulator](https://github.com/michaelromero212/GTM-AI-Workflow-Simulator)
*Reducing friction across the GTM customer journey with AI workflows.*
- **Problem**: Sales and CS teams lose pipeline velocity to manual lead research, inconsistent deal inspection, and reactive post-sales workflows — with no governance framework to safely deploy AI into these processes.
- **Solution**: A simulator that models AI agent deployment across the full revenue lifecycle — pipeline generation, deal execution, onboarding, and renewal — with governance guardrails, QA gates, A/B testing, and KPI tracking built in from day one.
- **Impact (Simulated)**: ~40% reduction in SDR research time, AI suggestion acceptance improved from 68% → 82% via structured prompt iteration, hallucination rate cut from 11% → 3% through pre-deployment QA.

#### [Databricks PS Knowledge Copilot](https://github.com/michaelromero212/Databricks-PS-Knowledge-Copilot)
*Enterprise RAG assistant for Professional Services teams.*
- **Problem**: Knowledge latency in high-stakes consulting environments leads to wasted search time and inconsistent answers across geographically distributed teams.
- **Solution**: A FastAPI + React knowledge assistant using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to ingest technical documentation and provide grounded, source-cited answers. Features local LLM integration (HuggingFace), ChromaDB vector search, and AI-powered document analysis with auto-generated summaries and topic tags.
- **Business Impact**: Eliminates consultant "search time," centralizes tribal knowledge, and ensures consistent, accurate answers across the PS organization—directly enabling faster client engagements.

#### [Engagement Runbook Generator](https://github.com/michaelromero212/Databricks-PS-AI-Engagement-Runbook-Generator)
*Automating the consulting lifecycle with Databricks-native tooling.*
- **Problem**: Manual formatting of engagement artifacts from kickoff notes, Slack exports, and architecture docs is error-prone and time-intensive—taking hours per engagement.
- **Solution**: An NLP-driven automation tool using Python, FastAPI, and Databricks Workflows to ingest unstructured data and generate standardized runbooks. Features MLflow experiment tracking, Bronze-layer data validation, and automated extraction of technologies, risks, deliverables, and timelines.
- **Business Impact**: Reduces runbook creation from **hours to minutes**, enables PS teams to scale concurrent engagements without manual overhead, and guarantees standardized document formats for all customer-facing deliverables.


#### [AI SDR Performance Operations Dashboard](https://github.com/michaelromero212/AI-SDR-Performance-Operations-Dashboard)
*Production-grade AI agent lifecycle management with governance, QA, and real-time monitoring.*
- **Problem**: Managing AI sales agents at scale requires governance, quality assurance, and continuous optimization—not just LLM deployment.
- **Solution**: A complete AI Operations platform featuring automated QA (15+ test scenarios), compliance frameworks, A/B testing, conversion analytics, and real-time agent monitoring.
- **Business Impact**: Demonstrates the full AI Ops PM skill set: process optimization, governance documentation, UAT coordination, KPI tracking, and field enablement.

#### [Enterprise Mission Intelligence Copilot](https://github.com/michaelromero212/enterprise-mission-intel-copilot)
*Turning unstructured data into actionable insights.*
- **Problem**: Critical mission data is often trapped in unstructured, high-latency formats.
- **Solution**: An Applied AI analyst tool for automated document intelligence and validated extraction.

### 🌐 Beyond the Code
I hold a **B.S. in Information Technology** from George Mason University and an active **DoD Secret Clearance**. My journey has taken me from automating **cybersecurity compliance and audit workflows at CACI** to engineering **high-scale AI data pipelines for deepfake detection at McAfee**. 

I am deeply passionate about **working with data**, **building interactive dashboards**, and **identifying business operations** that can be automated to drive efficiency. This GitHub profile serves as my primary project hub, where I host my work in bridging the gap between raw data and operational intelligence.

I specialize in building the "connective tissue"—the automation, observability, and data quality guardrails—that makes AI work in production.
